 * Description
 * -----------
 * Static block initialization implementation is similar to eager initialization, except that 
 * instance of the class is created in the static block that provides the option for exception handling.
 * 
 * Pros
 * ----
 * Avaiable exception handling.
 * 
 * Cons
 * ----
 * Both eager initialization and static block initialization create the instance even before 
 * itâ€™s being used and that is not the best practice to use.
